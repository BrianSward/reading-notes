## Readings: Authentication & Production Server

### Reading

[JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a standard for transmitting information as a JSON object
- JWTs have three parts: header, payload, and signature
- The header typically consists of two parts: the type of token, which is JWT, and the signing algorithm used like HMAC SHA256 or RSA
- The payload contains the claims - which are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. Claims are encoded as a JSON object
- The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way
- JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair (with RSA or ECDSA)
- Tokens are often sent in the Authorization header using the Bearer schema
- JWTs are commonly used for authentication and information exchange between parties in a compact, stateless, and secure way.

[DRF JWT Authentication](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2018/12/19/how-to-use-jwt-authentication-with-django-rest-framework.html)

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can be used to authenticate clients in a Django REST framework (DRF)
- DRF has built-in JWT support and makes it easy to implement
- In a typical implementation, the client first requests a token from the server by providing a username and password
  - The server then responds with a token, which the client can use for subsequent requests
- On each request, the client sends the token in the Authorization header, and the server uses the token to authenticate the client and provide access to resources
- To provide additional security, JWTs can be signed and encrypted, which makes it difficult for malicious actors to tamper with or forge tokens
-The Django REST framework provides several options for configuring the JWT authentication, including:
  - the ability to set a custom authentication class
  - customize the authentication process
  - handle exceptions and invalid tokens.

[Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server](https://build.vsupalov.com/django-runserver-in-production/)

- Django's development server, "runserver", is not suitable for production use
- Development server is single-threaded and does not handle multiple requests simultaneously
  - It does not automatically restart when code changes are made
  - It also does not provide robust error handling
  - It is not optimized for performance
- For these reasons, it is important to use a production-ready server when deploying Django applications
  Some common options include:
  - Gunicorn
  - uWSGI
  - Apache with mod_wsgi
- These servers provide multi-threading, automatic process management, and better error handling. Also they provide advanced features like:
  - load balancing
  - SSL support
  - request proxying
- When deploying a Django application, it is important to carefully choose a production-ready server that meets the specific needs of the application, taking into account factors such as performance, ease of use, and cost.
