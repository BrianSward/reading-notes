- [6 Tips](https://blog.usejournal.com/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)
  - Tip 1: Take a few Minutes
    - The tip discusses a common mistake where the interviewee tries to talk and solve the problem at the same time. 
    - The author suggests taking a moment to think through the problem before starting to talk. 
    - The interviewee should take time to clarify any questions and think about the problem, decide on an approach before re-engaging with the interviewer. 
    - The author emphasizes the importance of providing reasoning for the solution.
  - Tip 2: Write down the steps of the solution.
    - This very much seems like an instrucution to do an algo section like we have been instructed to our teacher. The idea that stepwise delineation is important.
  - Tip 3: Write pseudocode first.
    - They suggest pseudo code before coding, We have been instructed as python people to basically go from algo to code, I think the suggested direction JB gave us early on was to ask the interviewer if they expect a python pseudo code.
    - It is in the pseudo code can be considered a solution to a problem so if you run out of time or don't finish your code you will have something which will stand for your logic and reason.
    - This seems to be more code than an algo but less than a compiler.
  - Tip 4: Donâ€™t sweat the small stuff.
    - They highlight that programming interviews are not about memorizing syntax or technical details, but rather about demonstrating a candidate's knowledge, problem-solving skills, and personality. 
    - Making mistakes during the interview is acceptable and candidates should brush it off and move on. 
      - It is about how we handle those mistakes
    - If a candidate can't remember a specific detail, it's okay to admit and say that they would look it up. 
    - Focus should be on understanding the big picture.

### Videos

- [Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdXAUst8bdo)
  - End point of interview is to see who you want to hire not really to ask the best or most realistic questions
  - Interviews should be focused on testing a canidates problem solving skills and if someone is grilling you on harder concepts that is more of a test of knowlege than one of skill.
  - If you get stumped being honest and asking questions about asking questions, or mention how you would research something that is stumping you.
  - Must know your DSA and be comfortable with them, this should take a couple weeks. You know what you lack and focus on those.
  - There is no perfect process, and whiteboarding is the process with the least amount of flaws
  - Whiteboarding just assesses you have the minimum skills to code, think deeply, break problems down, etc, the things coders do
  - She suggests to interviewers not to ask obscure questions that rely more on trivia and less on problem solving skills
  - BST are prob fair game but not advanced BST things like balancing them.
  - Have confidence in your interviews and in yourself. Don't be cocky but don't give up if it goes bad as you might be able to pull it out in the end or demo to the interviewer your problem solving skills.
