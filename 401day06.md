## Readings: Testing and Modules

### Reading

- [How to use Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
  - often times we want a random number and this is the way to do that. there are many differrent things we can do here from getting a random integer or getting a random element from a list (like a list of names or something.). Things like coin flips and random groups and such can all be handled by this module.

- [What is Risk Analysis](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)
  - this is a concept in the software testing process where we id risks in our software/app, assign a severity to them, categorize them, and then finally calculate the impact if this risk were to occur
  - any unwanted result/incident is risk
  - risk analysis algo
    1. search for risk
    2. analyze impact of each risk
    3. measure for risks identified
  - three perspectitves of risk assessment
    - cause
    - effect
    - likelyhood
  - why use risk assessment?
    - to try to cut off problems at the pass 

- [Test Coverage](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html)
  - test coverage, or the amount of the code which is being tested. very helpful to find those bits of code which haven't been tested.
  - quality tests matter more than testing everything with useless tests.
  - goals for quality testing are
    - rarely encountering bugs that make it into production
    - rarely hesistant to change code for fear it will break things
    - test lengths shouldn't be a prohibition, run them on a test server if they take too long

### Videos

- [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)
  - pictures and pigeons to help us understand Big O, with how the runtime scales with respect to variables
  - four rules for big(o)
    1. different steps get added
    2. drop constants
    3. different inputs => different variables
    4. drop non-dominate terms
  - this whole thing can be explanied more easily as knowing your limits of common functions
