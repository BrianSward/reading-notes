# Class 4

## Readings: Testing and Modules

### Reading

- [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)

- Objects are functions and variables
- In python basically everything is an object
- Objects are things that do stuff
- Objects get their variables and functions from classes.
- Classes are templates to create your objects.
- When classes are being initiated you'll need a __init__() tossed in there for good measure

- [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
  - Optional: Naive Recursion is Naive section and beyond

- Oh! its cool to see a factorial.
- If base case, else recusive case
- Maintain state by keeping it in global scope
- Lists are recursive structures that you can dump into.  

- [Pytest Fixtures and Coverage](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)

- The article supports pytest and goes into two features specifically. These are Fixtures and Code Coverage
  - Fixtures: functions/data shared across multiple tests
    - Useful, flexible, can do its own data munching if desired
  - Code Coverage: the idea of testing all your code. this doesn't mean your code will be perfect but it helps you feel better that its working as intended
