# Class 12

## Readings: Testing and Modules

### Reading

- [Pandas in 10](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)
  - Holy crap! this was a huge load of information with example after example, How am i supposed to take notes on this, did you want me to cut and paste examples? But since most of the instruction is jank, here you go! No like seriously how am I expected to take notes on this, its a massive dense overview, this cannot be covered in 10 mins?
  - Well anyway this does contain a lot of information about how to do things in panda, it was basically everything you need to know to get started but with it being thousands of words and dozens upon dozens of examples reading a dictionary for 100% word retention is about as effective.
  - you said i should summarize this with a metaphor from my previous work expierence? well the material here reads like a maintenance manual for a m998 high mobility vehicle, in that it is technical, dry and sleep inducing.
