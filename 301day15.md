## Readings

### [What is OAuth](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html)

What is OAuth?

- It is an open standard authorization protocol. It describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow access without sharing login credentials

Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

- When websites allow me to use my gmail account to log in instead of creating an entire new account

How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

- It is a 11 step process according to the reading. First the websites connect and then share onetime passes to authenticate the user. The first site gives a passwork and key to the connecting client. The client presents this to their authorization provider. After this you’re authorized via 1 or 2 routes. The user’s software approves the transaction for the first website. The user is then granted access. The first website accepts the word of the second website. The user get to complete their transaction.

What is OpenID?

- It is often spoken about at the same time as OAuth, it began in 05 and it was first used by livejournal and would serve as a single sign up for multiple sites. Eventually it was replaced by things like facebook connect as the latter is more usable by devs and just does it all better.

### [Authorization and Authentication flows](https://auth0.com/docs/flows)

What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

- Simply put authorization Is a determination of who can access what, where as authentication is determining if you are who you say you are

What is Authorization Code Flow?

- A method of exchanging authorization codes for tokens

What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

- It is a process when Authorization Code Flow isn’t enough security and so it makes use of an additional security measure of PKCE

What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?

- This is something built inside of OAuth2.0 and it provides and alternative flow method called Implicit Flow. It is no longer considered the best method to do this.

What is Client Credentials Flow?

- On machine to machine applications the system itself authenticates and authorizes rather than the user

What is Device Authorization Flow?

- When devices such as cellphone or computers are used in the authentication process and the user will follow links submitted to these forms of technology

What is Resource Owner Password Flow?

- This is a practice used by highly trusted applications where the apps themselves provide username and password by using an interactive form
