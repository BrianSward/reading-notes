List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

- oh man it can do more than 4, but some from the reading include combining objects, adding an item to a list, using math functions, and combining arrays

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

- 
const arr1 = [1,2,3];
const arr2 = [4,5,6];

const newArr = [...arr1,...arr2];

Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

const arr1 = [1,2,3];
const arr2 = [4,5,6,...arr1];

console.log(arr2); would give us[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

const arr1 = {first three: "1,2,3"};
const arr2 = {next three: "4,5,6"};

const newObject = {...first three,...next three}
console.log(newObject) // Object { first three: "1,2,3", next three: "4,5,6" }

- that video was confusing, watched it a few times, still a little huh about it
