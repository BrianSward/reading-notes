What’s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

- REST is a system that uses HTTP commands to get resources while CRUD is a cycle we use to maintain data inside databases

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Identify your object model: This is the task of figuring out what exactly is represented in our application
2. Identify the URIs. URIs are the unique addresses assigned to our resources. Every resource we have must have a URL
3. Define the Representations. This is the step in figuring out what form our resources will come to us in. We’ve only used JSON to date but other common ones are XML or Protobuf
4. Assign HTTP Methods. Figure out how we want to access our info, are we creating something, retrieving something, or perhaps deleting something, all of these use different commands
5. Deal with Errors. Do yourself a favor and make sure you send your error codes back to yourself, also do this for those codes which mean success, your 200s 201s and 204s for example
