### Reading

[Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)

- Dunder methods are special methods in Python that define behavior for built-in operators, functions, and language features.
- They include methods for arithmetic operations, iteration, comparison, and more.
- Dunder methods can be used to define custom behavior for user-defined classes.
- They are an essential feature of Python's object-oriented programming model and are used extensively in the standard library.
- Using dunder methods can make code more readable and expressive, but overusing them can make code more complex.
- It's important to use them only when they provide clear benefits.

[Iterators](https://dbader.org/blog/python-iterators)

- Iterators let you traverse a collection of items one at a time.
- In Python, an iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which requires the iter() and next() methods.
- The iter() method returns the iterator object itself, while the next() method returns the next item in the sequence.
- You can define your own iterator by implementing the iterator protocol in a class.
- Python provides built-in functions and classes, like iter() and next(), that work with iterators.
- Iterators can handle sequences of any size, including very large ones that may not fit into memory all at once.
- They can be used in for loops, list comprehensions, and to define custom sequence types that support iteration.
- Using iterators can lead to more efficient and readable code, especially for large datasets or sequences.
- However, iterators are not suitable for collections that require random access or modification during iteration.

[Generators](https://dbader.org/blog/python-generators)

- Generators are a type of iterator that let you traverse a collection of items without loading the entire collection into memory.
- In Python, generators are defined using the yield keyword, which suspends the generator function and returns a value to the caller.
- When the generator function is called again, it resumes execution from where it left off and generates the next value on the fly.
- Generators can be used to generate large sequences of data, such as mathematical sequences, files, or network sockets.
- They can be used in for loops, list comprehensions, and other Python constructs that work with iterators.
- Generators are memory-efficient, especially for large datasets or sequences.
- They can be used to create custom iterable objects that support iteration.
- However, like iterators, generators are not suitable for collections that require random access or modification during iteration.

## Things I want to know more about

- These all seem very useful and would help with personal projects I have stalled out on. The job hunt will leave some time for this for sure.
