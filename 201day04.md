# Day 4 Reading

## Reading

### [Learn HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)

[Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

_To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?_

- an \<a> element

_The href attribute contains what information?_

- the url of the website the link takes you to

_What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?_

- by putting them in regular text and using clear link wording

### [CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)

[CSS Layout: Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow), [CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

_What is meant by “normal flow”?_

- normal flow refers to the default layout for the elements in css

_What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?_

- inline elements are the size of their content while block-level elements fill the available space inside the parent element

 _what positioning is the default for every html element?_

- our good ol' friend Static Positioning

_Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element._

- we can create lone UI elements that do not alter the appearance of the other elements on the page

_What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?_

- from the reading:
    " whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (An exception to this occurs if one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing block because its transform property has a value other than none.) This means that you can create useful UI items that are fixed in place, like persistent navigation menus that are always visible no matter how much the page scrolls."

### [Learn JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

[Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

_Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation._

- declaration is when you invent it, invocation is when you summon it to your code to do your bidding

_What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?_

- parameters are used when using the function, and our reading said the following, "Note: Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes." So this makes me think there is no difference.

### Miscellaneous
[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

_Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey._

- __Learning from fellow students__. When we work in groups or learn things in general we either don't bring all the available skills to th table or may miss something in class. Working in a group can allow for some of these gaps in knowledge to be immediately filled by those who have greater expierence in areas in comparison to you.

- __Engaged Collaboration__. All science is a collaboration. When we built the first computers to the atom bomb to probably the wheel. When you put smart people together working on a project in chorus your "song" will be more meaningful as the combined efforts of a group of brilliant people generally outshines the accomplishments of anyone indivdual. Topically speaking the James Wood Space Telescope wasn't built by one person. Cha'know?

## Things I want to know more about

- Wait so is there a difference between parameters and arguments?
