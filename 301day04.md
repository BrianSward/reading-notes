### [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- controlled components are input form elements where the values themselves are controlled by React

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- we should wait until they click submit so they are given a chance to change their inputs if they've made a mistake and they catch it

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- we put name attributes on each element and let the handler choose what to do based upon predetermined values

### [The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

Why would we use a ternary operator?

- when we would like to shorten our if statements into one line code chunks instead of five lines. it also helps for readability

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
