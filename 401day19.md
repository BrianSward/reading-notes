### Reading

- [Python Regular Expressions Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-regular-expression-tutorial)
  - I like regular expressions, I enjoyed them in javascript and was the person on our final project team to write the search keys. I think what appeals to me is the odd syntax and its obscurity in general.
  - Basic Regular Expressions
    - Covers basic syntax and structure of regular expressions, including special characters for matching patterns.
    - Explains how to use regular expressions to match single characters and groups of characters.
    - Provides examples of basic regular expressions in Python. Refer to this in future for help if needed.
  - Advanced Regular Expressions
    - Explores advanced topics such as matching specific characters and using regular expressions for complex tasks.
    - Describes how to use regular expressions for matching and replacing text.
    - Provides examples of advanced regular expressions for tasks such as matching dates and email addresses.
  - Conclusion
    - In short, the article aims to give a comprehensive understanding of regular expressions and their uses in Python, and encourages readers to use them in their data analysis and text processing projects.
    - The conclusion of this page encourages readers to practice using regular expressions in Python, as it is an essential skill for data analysis and text processing.
    - It also offers support and advice for troubleshooting regular expressions and would be worth revisiting when i get into regex in the real world or future projects

- [shutil](https://pymotw.com/3/shutil/)
  - shutil module: The shutil module provides a set of high-level operations on files and collections of files. It can be used to copy, move, and delete files and directories.
  - here are a bunch of examples of what we can do
    - shutil.copy() can be used to copy a single file
    - shutil.copytree() can be used to copy an entire directory and its contents.
    - shutil.move() can be used to move a file or directory from one location to another.
    - shutil.rmtree() can be used to remove a directory and all its contents.
    - shutil.make_archive() can be used to create an archive file (e.g. zip or tar)
    - shutil.unpack_archive() can be used to extract a zip
    - shutil.which() can be used to find the location of an executable file in the system path.
    - shutil.disk_usage() can be used to check the disk usage statistics for a specific path.
    - shutil.chown() can be used to change the owner and group of a file or directory.
    - shutil.copy2() is similar to shutil.copy(), but also preserves metadata (like file permissions and timestamps).
