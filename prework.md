## SQL

### Summary of Understanding on SQL

- Well I understand that it is a relational database system with powerful and much easier than excel use to combine data sets with keys - both primary and secondary. You declair these things when you make your databases and having it all sketched out on some paper beforehand will help you in the end. I have done this in the past with vlookups but it is a clunky and while workable it is a limited iteration of what you can do with SQL RE joining sets and playing with data. It will be nice to use it in our class and get us ready to use it in the market. I have compeleted the Google Course on Data Analytics over on coursera and I got it use it there, but knowing that I get to learn it again and hopefully get to do some projects where it and python hangout together and have a good time will be something else I look forward to.

## Bash

### The Command Line

- Learnings: Ugh, they explained a command line to me? I've been using these since 1984.
- Observations: Explainations for windows machines sucked. Basically you're screwed have some fun doing it yourself as I mention software I don't even explain. If I didn't know what I already do this would have been a useless place for me to start out as a newb.

### Basic Navigation

- Learnings: Again, this is lots of review for me. I wrote my first autoexec.bat in 1988, and used to use ATDT to manually rouse my modem when connecting to BBSes.
- Observations: I guess the /etc and such were new to me but at this point they only serve to have me say oh cool look at all that non-sense Also the dif between relative and absolute pathing is important as they mention it mulitple times but again I already knew about that from my previous CF courses and my work before all this.

### More About Files

- Learnings: Lots more review. Using quotes around names with spaces is cool, but like also don't put names in spaces, make your life easier. I will have to remember the -a flag as I use it a lot but basically have to look it up everytime I do so.
- Observations: Take aways: Everything is a file, No Extensions in linux, Case matters in file names. Uh this is exactly why you shouldnt use spaces in file names because you have such freedom here with casing.

### Manual Pages

- Learnings: man will helps us with commands. It is out manual and we can look up syntax with it or review commands we use infrequently.
- Observations: ok like this is something I didn't know and can instantly see its use -  hizzah for new (useful) info finally.

### File Manipulation

- Learnings: a lot of review of basic commands to create and knock around files. nothing new to report.
- Observations: The let us know there is no undo and lots of options with commands and to look at the manual from time to time.

### Cheat Sheet

- Learnings: I learned there is a spot on this guys site which has a whole slew of commands. I linked it below for future reference.
- Observations: [Cheat Sheet Link](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php)
