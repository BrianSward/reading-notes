### MDN Control Flow

The __control flow__ is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

- Basically this is the idea of PEMDAS/BODMAS for code
  - Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless code changes the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
  - A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many _control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions._
  - Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### Functions

- JavaScript functions are blocks of code designed to do something.
- functions are executed when it is called

JavaScript Function Syntax - functions are defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ()

- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
- The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
- The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
- Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
  - Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other programming languages.

Function Invocation
Code executes/invokes/calls the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

    __More will come on this in the future__

Function Return

- When JavaScript reaches a return statement it stops
- If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
- Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

Why Functions?
Make something once, use it over and over. You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

__Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.__

- Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations. COMPOSIE FUNCTIONS!

_Local Variables_ - Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

### Operators

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic

- Addition +
- Subtraction -
- Multiplication *
- Exponentiation (ES2016) --
- Division /
- Modulus (Division Remainder) %
- Increment ++
- Decrement --

JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Operator    Example     Same As  

Ragequit (this is stupid and the formatting here is dumb, i followed instructions on how to make a chart and it kept screwing up and by screwing up i mean not making one THERE ARE CHARTS AND IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE THEM NOW BUT HERE WE ARE)

    NOTE TO READER: Priovidng a futures student with a quick, working, way to introduce charts (columns and rows) would be so helpful expecially for people who strive to put things in ordered clumps. As the no html for notes rules and a desire to have gridded out areas for me to deposit information would be most useful and again what i googled for markdown, didn't work.

### Expressions and Operations

binary and unary operators, ternary operator (conditional operator)

- binary require two oeprands, one before and one after, like math
- unary requires single command either before or after like x++ or ++x

assignment operators assign values

chaining or nesting assingments can be a bad time

"When chaining these expressions without parentheses or other grouping operators like array literals, the assignment expressions are grouped right to left (they are right-associative), but they are evaluated left to right."

basically AVOID ASSIGNMENT CHAINS

See article for more on this if confused. The note taking is distracting from the learning process

### OHMYGODWHYFunctions

reading similar to above function yet with more exaustive lists and examples, basically the above but with more words and larger examples. this will be a good source once my understanding of material is solidified and i understand the purpose of these items better
