## Readings: Serverless Functions

### Reading

- [What is Serverless Computing? (up to Pros and Cons)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless)
  - What is serverless?
    - Serverless are cloud computing development and execution models that helps devs while they build and test code without a bunch of server nonesense.
  - lets people focus on writing the best front end code possible
  - does not mean NO SERVERS, they are just invisible to devs as they just don't interact with them. you interact LESS with the SERVERS
  - the reading made a point to show that this isn't just containers or FaaS - function as a service. ok they get technical in the reading so we're going to copy and paste this info because rewording it seems like more work than the terms it is in
    - Serverless databases and storage: Databases (SQL and NoSQL) and storage (particularly object storage) are the foundation of the data layer. A serverless approach to these technologies involves transitioning away from provisioning “instances” with defined capacity, connection and query limits, and moving toward models that scale linearly with demand in both infrastructure and pricing.
    - Event streaming and messaging: Serverless architectures are well-suited for event-driven and stream-processing workloads most notably the open source Apache Kafka event streaming platform.
    - API gateways: API gateways act as proxies to web actions and provide HTTP method routing, client ID and secrets, rate limits, CORS, viewing API usage, viewing response logs, and API sharing policies.
  - Serverless vs PaaS (platform as a service) vs containers and VMs. the reading breaks down the differences between these as follows
    - provisioning, is faster with serverless
    - admin burden, is less for serverless
    - maintenance, is the same for all
    - scaling, instant for serverless
    - capacity planning, none needed for serverless
    - statelessness, inherent for serverless, so scalability is never a problem
    - high availablity and disaster recovery, both come for free with serverless and no effort or extra cost
    - resource usage, 100% efficiency for serverless
    - billing granularity and savings, serverless is billed by the millisecond, while others are billed by the hours
  - Serverless, Kubernetes and Knative
    - Kubernetes are open source containers which help with use and growth of containers. cant run serverless on its on in these but serverless is often done in containers.
    - so thats whrre Knative comes in as it provides serverless for Kubernetes
    - "Knative is transparent to developers—they just build a container as usual using Kubernetes, and Knative does the rest, running the container as a serverless workload."
  - Pros and Cons of Serverless
    - Pros
      - Improved developer productivity
      - Pay for execution only
      - Develop in any language
      - Streamlined development/DevOps cycles
      - Cost-effective
      - Usage visibility
      - More [benifits](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ZJLWQOAQ)
    - Cons
      - um the reading didn't mention any cons? :D did i miss something? or are there just none?

### Videos

- [What is Serverless?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxJobGtqKVM)
  - this video was nicer than the reading but i think i have made the point before i learn better with someone talking with pictures, don't get me wrong i do like the readings, but here with him showing things on axes - oh nice!
  - but ultimately the reading had more info and most of the important points he made are covered the the reading summary above.
