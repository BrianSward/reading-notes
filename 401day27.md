## Readings: Django Models 

### Reading

- [Using Models](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Models)
  - oh wow something to actually summarize :D
  - Django web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models
  - These models define the data structures of stored data where Django handles the heavy lifting for you after you define initial parameters.
  - It is suggested we gave a seperate model for every object - group of related deets
  - After we decide on models we have to decide on how they interact with each other
  - Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file
  - They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model, and can include fields, methods and metadata.
  - Refer to the reading for a list of common arguements used in models. Additionally refer to the reading for a list of common field types.
  - Metadata at the model level helps you achieve some sorting. allow for permissions, ordering based on other fields, newest to oldest, etc...
  - Methods, yes they have methods. They can be used but the minimum you have to have is a __str__() to return something which would be readable to a human being.
  - Once model classes are known you can use them to do things like create, update or delete records or even run queries across subsets of records.
  - Local Library Models
    - genre model - like if a book is a military book or a history or romance
    - book model - titles and isbns
    - book instance model - a specific book people might borrow

    As you can see, this is all great, lets move on...
  - Once your models are created you can no re-run you database migrations to make sure everything is cherry



- [Django Admin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Admin_site)

  - Advanced configuration section is optional
  - The tutorial is really good but some of the tools are dated so when reading try to understand the concepts more than the code.
  - Notes:
    - "Admin application use models to build site areas that we can use to create view update and delete records." 
    - You have to open admin.py and register your models there
    - You have to create a superuser
    `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
    - Rerun your server, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin and have a blast with your admin power
    - The rest of this has become a recap of our class lecture. 

(Optional): [Beginner’s Guide to Django - Part 1](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html)

- This goes into a summary of why django citing its massive libraries as a reason to use it alone. It then goes into who uses django.
- Installation using a dated version of python, lets skip this part...
- The conclusion recaps this tutorial and goes through the whole process of making an app. Adam did it better though.
