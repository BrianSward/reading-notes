## Reading

### [Learn HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

[Ordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) and [Unordered Lists](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul)

_When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?_

- when order is meaningless

_How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?_

- using the type attribute equal to ciercle, disc, or square

_When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?_

- in something that is ordered like a recipe or something rendered as a list of numbers/steps

_Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?_

- either the type attribute just like the unordered list or the list-style-type

### [Learn CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)

[The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)

_Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?_

- doctor jeckyl and mr hyde. as they never meet and are seperated by a strict boundary (the border)

_List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model._

1. Content box: where your content is shown
2. Padding box: wraps around as negative space, usually white
3. Border box: surrounds content and all the padding
4. Margin box: the icing on the box, works as a buffer between other boxes

### [Learn JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

[Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays), [Operators and Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), [Conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals), [Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code)

_What data types can you store inside of an Array?_

- numbers, strings of text, objects, or nested arrays

_Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?_

- I think it is one because i put it into repl and i was able to see its length is 3, or i can see all the entries for one of the elements.

_List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do._

1. += addition assignment, adds to and reassigns
2. -= subtraction assignment, subs from and reassigns
3. *= multiplication assignement, multiplys and reassigns
4. /= division assignment, divides by and reassigns
5. %= remainder assignment, uses modular math to reassign

_Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why._

- 10dog. As it first adds 10 to nothing, then without adding a space as none is provdided puts dog right at the end of it. I checked this in repl to be sure.

_Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program._

- if you wanted your website to behave differently at different times of day

_Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript._

- when you need to iterate through something multiple times. something which is algorithmic in its process

## Things I want to know more about

- That box model is something which I will need to look at again as there are hours of info and lost of it makes no sense now.
