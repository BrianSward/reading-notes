    - the DPS (Develop, Preview, Ship) Workflow
    - Deployment of your Next.js app to your own hosting service
  - The Setup tab covers the basic set up of the application
  - After setup you have to push your app to github, they go into that process
  - Then we push it to github
  - Next they show us how to push it to vercel
    - vercel is made by the same people who make next.js
  - Eventually they say it can be deployed anywhere that is compat with Next.js
  and explain how to enter in those params for these other sites
