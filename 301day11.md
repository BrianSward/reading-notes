Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

1. SQL are relational databases while noSQL are primarly non-relational or distributed databases
2. SQL databases are table baseed while NoSQL databases are document based
3. SQL databases have predefined schema while noSQL have dynamic schema
4. SQL databases scale vertically where as NoSQL scale horizontally.
5. SQL databses use structured query language for defining and manipulating data while NoSQL has queries focused on collections of documents.

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

- hieratchical data 

Give a real world example.

- those where complex queries are used

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

- for big data

Give a real world example.

- managing big data by companies like the new york times, craigslist, and mtv

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- a SQL data base

Which type of database is best for scalability?

- they both scale in different ways, it depends on application and speed

What is a relational database?

- a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another usually via multiple tables

What type of structure does a relational database work with?

- tables

What is a ‘schema’?

- what data can go into what fields

What is a NoSQL database?

- from mongodb themselves, "NoSQL (“non SQL” or “not only SQL”) databases were developed in the late 2000s with a focus on scaling, fast queries, allowing for frequent application changes, and making programming simpler for developers

How does it work?

- with collections and documents instead of tables like in sql

What is inside of a Mongo database?

- lots and lots of data stored in a very efficient way

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

- MongoDB as it allows for changes to be made. it also can use elements of SQL if it desires. information is often more available as its repeated at times.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

- they don't support ACID and many applications require ACID
- you will have duplicate data
