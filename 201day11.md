# Day 10 Reading Notes

## Reading

### [Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

_Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s._

- as bandwidth improved we wanted to start using images and videos but lacked an interface so we started with things like flash and silverlight. with the implimentation of HTML5 this was rendered obsolilte but people still used them until dec 2020 when it finally kicked the bucket

_Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the \<video> element._

- src is the SOURCE of our file and we use it similar to the use of src in an \<img>. controls allows us to start and stop a video or alter its volume. these are tht bare min and exist to help people with disabilities such as epilepsy

_Why is it important to have fallback content inside the \<video> element?_

- incase the video is not properly displayed due to poor speed, browser compatiability or even like a link so they can get to the video if the embedding fails

_Write a very short story where \<audio> and \<video> are characters._

- it was 2005, both \<audio> and \<video> were sent to fight against the global war of flash. after basic training they were deployed overseas and landed in a hot LZ. right from the jump the began pushing adobe flash right back to the holes it came out of. Much like the 20 year war in afghanistan this one lasted almost as long with the flash ulitmately succombing to the overwhealming force of fire that were \<video> and \<audio>.  

### [A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

_How does Grid layout differ from Flex?_

- it confuses me in a seperate but equally baffling way. aside from that you have to call out the size of the grid before using it and then you proceed to chop it up into pieces which are useful to you. this varies from flex as none of that happens in flex, you just are moving it around inside its specified "container" as opposd to specifically creating one like in grid

_Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences._

- __grid container__ - this is the element where you display the grid and it is the direct parent of the grid items contained therein
- __grid item__ - these are the kiddos/children of the grid container. these are considered direct descendents of the grid containter which im sure is important with inheirited properties
- __grid line__ - these are the lines which divide the container to make up the structure fo the grid itself. they can be column or row defining

### [Responsive Images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

_Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?_

- I mean the article we read seemed to really say quite a bit about the different resolutions and different devices browsing the web as a key reason why we want responsitivity; this concept is called resolution switching. the other they mention and it is mych shoters is for the art direction of the website.

_Define the following \<img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used._

- srcset will get images of different sizes based upon different criteria (seemingly from the article )

_How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?_

- because of the order in which websites load images. basically if we used css/java script there might be a chance that the wrong image size might load

## Things I want to know more about

- i need better people skills for real. also i was hoping for something on git after the lab to help because man that lab was frustraiting.
