## Readings: Testing and Modules

### Reading

- [Python Scope](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/)
  - GLOBAL - available everywhere inside a module
    - you can declare things global with "global" - this will allow them to access and edit global variables, or even declare them inside functions in a "lazy" manner
  - NONLOCAL - a level of scope to functions which are inside of other fuctions
    - using it in other ways seems to kick back errors
    - cannot be used to make lazy variables

### Videos

- [Don't be CONFUSED by BIG O notation anymore!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uqawfl0VHQ)
  - this video is private my youtube told me, so I couldn't do this

## Things I want to know more about

- one of the things i know about scope is to make a python file called config.py stick your globals in there and then import them at the top of the page. is this not a good way to do it? i found this much easier than dealing with global/nonlocal business
