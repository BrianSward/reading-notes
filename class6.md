## Response

### JS Intro Paragraph

- __JavaScript (JS)__ is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
- Most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages
- Many non-browser environments also use it
  - such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
- JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.
- Java != JavaScript
- JavaScript has standards

### Input and Output in JS

- This was a quick overview of how to ask for inputs and render them as outputs by referencing the aged hello world scenario.

### Variables

JavaScript Variables
4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:

- var, let, const, or nothing

What are Variables?
Variables are containers... great ghost of euler I have a math degree

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

- var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
- let is 2015 onward
- older browser, you must use var!

When to Use JavaScript const (constant)?

__If you want a general rule__ always declare variables with const
__If you think it can change)__ use let.
In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

- These unique names are called identifiers.
- Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
- The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
  - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  - Names must begin with a letter
  - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
  - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
  - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

- In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.
  - The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

- JavaScript Data Types
  - Strings are text values, for now numbers are strings!
  - Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
  - If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:

It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input.

A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.

The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement:

__You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.__

Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names:

### How Computers Work - Playlist

Video 1

- overview of the whole series

Video 2

- how computers were developed to manipulate information
- calculus overtime of computer industry
- input are instructions/information to computer
- this is then procesessed and then output results

Video 3

- overview of binary number systems
- how stuff is stored/represented using binary

Video 4

- overview of circuits and how they interact with binary
- they then hit logic, and, adders, im sure nor, and not are also here
- smaller computers are faster as the data has less distance to travel as electricty (on/off) travels close to speed of light

Video 5

- overview of hardware devices and how they relate to inputs and outputs
- ultimately its all about inputs and outputs

Video 6

- dogs! the real reason one would ever work at amazon
- software described, and its interaction with the components of hardware
- relation to programming lang to binary
- operating systems and how they direct the computers resources.
