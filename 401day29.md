## Readings: Django Custom User

### Reading

- [Django Custum User Model](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model)
  - This was the link we used in class to set up the Custom User Models. This article covers all the important steps along the way to make sure your install is successful. It includes:
    - the setup
    - model creation
    - the v/u/t process
  - Very useful link to have in the end

- [DjangoX](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox)
  - this is a github of the djangox template discussed in our lecture today. It is significant for a couple of reasons, for one its free, the author is a reknown django whiz, and it takes a lot of the pain and heavy lifing out of our projects
  - the downside is it comes with bootstrap which some of the class seemed to have some feels about but like i don't remember bootstrap being so horrible in comparison to bare css.

### Videos

Choose one:
- [Creating a Custom User Model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCeRC7E8Z7Y&t=59s)

- [Abstract User, User Profile and Signals in Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EudKs1HPUfE)
  - for ease i will review this article because it just flows nicer
  - User models contain the following fields
    - email, username, password come by default 
    - but if you wanted to add storage quota, picture you have to add extra user fields
  - How do we do this? Based upon how advanced project is. But basically for new projects it is simple. Derive your own user class to class SampleUser(AbstractUser): kinda shenanagins
  - then update settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL
  - he suggests these last two steps are MUST do right off the bat
  - He goes into the whole don't migrate until you make your models, so this is something that was also covered in class and I added to my notes, but it was nice to see what happens when you do this in the wrong order.
    - He goes into the steps on how to correct this if you did it by accident. deep but good info here.

## Things I want to know more about

- In the video the guy did this stuff with land, what the heck was that or was that what he called his app and then the stuff with signals.py - I suppose this is more of an example if I ever get stuck here.
