# Day 2 - 6/28/2022

## Notes on [Git Tutorial](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)
- meta comment, hah solid understanding of terminal is a prereq, i'm screwed

## What is Git?
- Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots
- Git mostly relies on local operations
- Tracks changes
- Minimize loss of data
- Tracks state

## History of Git
- Started in '05... dear god [here](http://www.google.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)

## Customization
- GUI is available - [GUI](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
- Can also adjust user settings, colors, and such

## Git Repository
- Can be made, imported, cloned
- Made of three components Working Directory (where files live), Index (staging area), Head (points to most recent commit)
- Saves are either Tracked or Untracked, not sure what this means
- All this commiting changes and file status sh1t makes no sense, find a youtube video about this
-  -  The Life Cycle of File Status, Check File Status, Tracking and Staging a New File, Committing a File, Committing All Changes, Pushing Changes, Stashing Changes
## Remote Repositories - Versions which live online
- _Cloned Reponsitories_ -\ they can be remote as well as local
- _Seeing Your Remotes_ -\ By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
- _Adding Remotes_ -\ Can add them also
- _Fetching_ -\ or get them
- _Pushing_ -\ allows for changing
- _Renaming/Removing Remotes_ -\ self explainitory

## Undoing Actions
- You can undo actions
- Various ways, Commit Mistakes, Unstaging a File, Undo a Committed Snapshot, Unmodifying a File

## Branching
- Common trait of version control systems
- you create branches of a central repository, collaborators are able to work simultaneously via multiple branches, without affecting this main repository.
- Watch a you tube video on this! This seems very important when you actually work with other people
- Can also switch a branch, list branches, and other things

## Merging
- This is bring multiple branches together
-
