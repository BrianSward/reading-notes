# Day 6 Reading Notes

## Reading

### [JavaScript Object Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)

_How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?_

- objects are collections of things, it could really be anything but most often in JS we are usually storing numbers or maybe instructions \(functions) for future inputs to come

_What are some advantages to creating object literals?_

- We use object literals whenwe wanna send a series of items, like sending requests to a server for addition into a database as sending a single thing is better  than sending several things in a row. also it is eaier to work with individual values than arrays where we can call them by name

_How do objects differ from arrays?_

- arrays will store matrices of infomation for recall at a later time and place. objects represent things with properties which can be called as well. array isn't as readable as objects always

_Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation._

- "If an object property name is defined at runtime then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can pass the name as a variable inside brackets" This is a quote from our reading and i chose to take it in directly as a quote because I couldn't say it any better myself and I dont really understand what it is saying anyhow.

_Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?_

- when using the code 'this' in the block it seems to refer to the object you are currently creating and acessing its elements on a console.log

### [Introduction To The DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

_What is the DOM?_

- DOM is the Document Object Model which is the data of the objects that create the structure and content of the file on the web

_Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript._

- DOM isn't a part of Javascript and it uses web APIs do create websites and we know by this point what JS does. Their relationship is that DOM isn't a language like JS but it allows JS to have understanding of what webpages and their resources are and hwo to use the,. The reading goes on to say the following: "...  document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts of the document object model for that document. They can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and a scripting language like JavaScript."

[Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming](http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/07/15/understanding-the-problem-domain-is-the-hardest-part-of-programming)

- suggests getting past the hardest problem in the following two ways
  1. mate the problem domain eaiser
  2. get better at understanding problem domain
  - __problem domain__ is the score of a project or what you intend to accomplish, what your contstraints are, the context of the problem itsef, where the solution will have to live. basically all the deets on the problem and more than you can generally think of

[What’s the difference between primitive values and object references in JavaScript?](https://betterprogramming.pub/intermediate-javascript-whats-the-difference-between-primitive-values-and-object-references-e863d70677b)

- these are the classifications of data types in javascript. there are eight different types.
- these will also effect when you do references and equality checks as promitives contain direct values and object references contain references, not values
