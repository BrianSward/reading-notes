## Reading

### [React Docs - Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)

What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

- Single responsibibiltiy principle and its relation to components is that components should ideally only do one thing. hehe i need to work on this for sure...

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

- it means creating a model of your site that doesn't use things like state to handle anything. basically the site should be completed without interactivity

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

- locating and id'ing the minimal requirements to make your site interactive. that is find the absolute minimum set of state that you need to achieve operational success

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

- Is it passed in from a parent via props?
- Does it remain unchanged over time?
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component?

How can you identify where state needs to live?

- our reading supplies the following four steps 
  1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
  2. Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
  3. Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
  4. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

### [Higher-Order Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html#h_xxCc98lOBK)

What is a “higher-order function”?

- Higher Order Functions are those that take as arguements or return other functions. Basically if you operate on other functions you're a higher order function

Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

- it is comparing m to n and returning the m's that are larger than the n's 

Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

- Reduce works by building values via taking a single element over and over from an array and 'combining' it with the current value. for example, Whenyou add numbers, you’d start with zero and each element to the sum.

## Things I want to know more about

- this would be totally useful for doing the code challenge and lab from today, hah!
