## Readings: Permissions & Postgresql

### Reading

- [DRF Permissions](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/)
  - Permissions act as part of the triad of tools which grant or deny access.
  - Permissions (REST) are defined inside the permissions class.
  - Object Level Permissioning is supported in REST frameworks.
  - It discusses that default permissions can be set globally if desired and goes into how to do that with some code block. Frankly it looks like it might become a tutorial soon, which yah, these aren't much fun to take notes on.
  - API References (see original for full sections)
    - AllowAny - The AllowAny permission class will allow unrestricted access, regardless of if the request was authenticated or unauthenticated.
    - IsAuthenticated - The IsAuthenticated permission class will deny permission to any unauthenticated user, and allow permission otherwise.This permission is suitable if you want your API to only be accessible to registered users.
    - IsAdminUser - The IsAdminUser permission class will deny permission to any user, unless user.is_staff is True in which case permission will be allowed.
    - IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly - The IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly will allow authenticated users to perform any request. Requests for unauthorised users will only be permitted if the request method is one of the "safe" methods; GET, HEAD or OPTIONS.
    - DjangoModelPermissions - These tie into standard django.contrib.auth model permissions
      - Def need to refer to this for future reference
      - Post to add, Put/Patch to change, and Delete to delete
      - Can always add custom ones like a read only view associated to get requests
  - Override BasePermissions to use custom ones using either or both of the following methods
    - .has_permission(self, request, view)
    - .has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj)
    - Refer to reading for more details
  - REST framework has three ways (models) to adjust access on a user (case-by-case) basis. These all have different use scenarios with different effects and limitations.
  - The following Third Party Packages are available:
    - DRF - Access Policy: The Django REST - Access Policy package provides a way to define complex access rules
    - Composed Permissions: The Composed Permissions package provides a simple way to define complex and multi-depth (with logic operators) permission objects, using small and reusable components.
    - REST Condition: The REST Condition package is another extension for building complex permissions in a simple and convenient way. The extension allows you to combine permissions with logical operators.
    - DRY Rest Permissions: The DRY Rest Permissions package provides the ability to define different permissions for individual default and custom actions.
    - Django Rest Framework Roles: The Django Rest Framework Roles package makes it easier to parameterize your API over multiple types of users.
    - Django REST Framework API Key: The Django REST Framework API Key package provides permissions classes, models and helpers to add API key authorization to your API.
    - Django Rest Framework Role Filters: The Django Rest Framework Role Filters package provides simple filtering over multiple types of roles.
    - Django Rest Framework PSQ: The Django Rest Framework PSQ package is an extension that gives support for having action-based permission_classes, serializer_class, and queryset dependent on permission-based rules.

- [Review SQL Prework](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/prework/SQL)
  - I like that everytime I go back to SQL Bolt it resets my progress and I have to redo everything. But yeah, this is just pre-work, I guess we will be hitting the SQL hard soon which will be nice.
