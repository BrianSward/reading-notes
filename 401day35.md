## Readings: Implementation: Graphs

### Reading

- [Read: Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)

note: I f'ing love graph theory, I have given speeches on Eulerian traversals/graphs and the Bridges of Konigsberg problem.

- Introduction to Graphs
  - Graphs are a type of data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them.
  - Graphs can be used to represent relationships and connections between objects.
- Types of Graphs
  - Undirected Graphs: Edges have no direction and can be traversed in either direction.
  - Directed Graphs: Edges have a direction and can only be traversed in one direction.
  - Weighted Graphs: Edges have a value assigned to them, representing their weight or cost.
  - Cyclic Graphs: Graphs that contain cycles, meaning it's possible to travel from one node back to the same node.
  - Acyclic Graphs: Graphs without cycles, meaning it's not possible to travel from one node back to the same node.
- Applications of Graphs
  Here is a list of some of the things we do with graph theory besides entertain my shower thoughts:
  - Network topology
  - Social networks
  - Web graphs
  - Transportation and navigation
  - Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Graph Representation
  - Adjacency Matrix: A 2-dimensional matrix where each row and column represent a node, and the value at the intersection of two nodes represents an edge.
  - Adjacency List: A list where each node is assigned a list of nodes it is connected to.
- Graph Traversal
  -Breadth-First Search (BFS): Traverses the graph layer by layer, visiting all neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.
  - Depth-First Search (DFS): Traverses the graph by following a path as far as possible before backtracking.
- Graph Algorithms
  - Shortest Path: Finding the shortest distance between two nodes.
  - Minimum Spanning Tree: Finding the minimum tree that connects all nodes in a graph.
  - Maximum Flow: Finding the maximum flow of a graph from a source node to a sink node.
  - Topological Sort: Sorting nodes in a graph such that for every directed edge (u, v), node u comes before node v.
    - I additionally love topology, How do I python with theoretical maths?
- Conclusion
  - Graphs are a powerful data structure with many applications in various fields.
  - Graphs can be represented using either an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list, and can be traversed using BFS or DFS.
  - Graph algorithms such as Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree, Maximum Flow, and Topological Sort, can be used to solve complex problems.

## Things I want to know more about

- how do i python with theoretical maths, things like abstract algebra, ring theory, topology, complex analysis?
