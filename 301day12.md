## Reading

### [Status Codes Based On REST Methods](https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Which-HTTP-Status-Code-To-Use-For-Every-CRUD-App/)

In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

100’s = info codes that will tell us that the header part of the request was recived and the server will try to do what you ask 
200’s = these codes are what we're looking for, they mean everything was accepted
300’s = this tells us that what we're looking for has moved to a differernt location
400’s = client error codes representing invalid requests being made to the server
500’s = server error codes, this show us whats up with servers (overloaded, unreachable) or if you're behind a proxy or something 

What is a status code 202?

- asynchronous processing of a request, our reading says, "Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future."

What is a status code 308?

- permanent redirect, again our reading says, "This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore."

What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

- code 204, no content

What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

- 410 Gone, this means a resource existed but it is no longer here

What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

- 403 the client cannot access the resource

### [Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick - First 20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw)

Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

- to protect the key's secrecy 

What is middleware?

- it handles requests to and from clients and servers and provides structure for the whole process. better than us writing our own middleware

What does app.use(express.json()) do?

- it handles/parses the json requests and places the data in request.body

What does the /:id mean in a route?

- it is a route parameter that reads, for example req.params or request.params

What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

- they are both methods but put sends data to update an entire resource where as patch is a partial modificaton of the data but not everything

How do you make a default value in a schema?

- by using the default keyword

What does a 500 error status code mean?

- this is some sort of error on the server end

What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

- 200 means that the request was recieved and understood and is now on its way to be processed. 201 is that the request again was successful but now we have a resource being created
