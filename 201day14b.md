## [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.google.com/amp/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.amp.html)

The reading was about Google's Project Aristotle, its findings. It is told through Julia Rozovsky and her experiences. basically google did a lot of research on how to make the perfect team, in the end it basically comes down to people feeling safe with those around them and not so much the composition of the team and if everyone knows each other. and how since this is a feeling sort of interaction it is difficult to optimize or catch in the data always. but it does give us a path forward on how to be constructive with our fears, insecurities, and aspirations.Â 

they mention a sense of being able to be your self and not having to put on some mask around your coworkers and the exhaustion such false appearances take on employees when they're on the job.

## Things I would like to learn about?

- is there a youtube video that conveys this information as well? it would be helpful for me as i would like to have visual history/animation/overview to supplement this reading which was a little dry.
