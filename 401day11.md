- [Numpy Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)
  - built on the shoulders of other modules
  - the go to place when you think data and python
  - machine learning people also cut their teeth here
  - they show opening csvs with import, but you can use pandas too which is part of jupyter... humm why didn't they show they
  - arrays are mutable, comparable, combinable, and in addition to math and basic array arithmatic you can compare sets and subsets
