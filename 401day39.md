    - Consuming a Context: The article explains how to consume a context using the useContext hook and how to access the data stored in the context.
    - Updating a Context: The article explains how to update a context using a Provider component and how to pass data to the Provider component using the value prop.
    - When to use Context: The article explains when it is appropriate to use the React Context API, such as when you need to share data between components that are not directly connected in the component tree.
  - Overall, the article provides a comprehensive introduction to the React Context API and covers the essential concepts you need to know to start using the API in your own React applications.

## Videos

- [Why Iâ€™m using Next.js in 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtgbaKBhdkk)
  - we already watched this video. here are my previously submitted notes on it:
    - React fan-boy talks about the future of React, which he says is Next.js
    - I don't think his lips match the sound, it really bugs me
    - He gives a background on React and Next.js
    - Next.js allows us to decide on where it is rendered, client side or server side.
    - getStaticPass and getStaticProps he seems to be into
    - A long winded talk on performance of Next.js which seems to allow for scaling and such as you're only loading a page at a time (if you elect to which like you sould)
    - Next.js takes into account the dev experience which he seems to imply it makes out life better (he keeps talking about plug in set ups)
    - He is also high on how you deploy Next.js - huge plug for vercel but ANY node server will work, you can selfhost or aws it as well.
    - Huge dev community, they work with google and facebook.
      - 5 of top 12 companies use it
    - Future might be the merger of front and back end
- [Learn useContext In 13 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LrDIWkK_Bc)
  - he goes over basic context in react
  - he uses React.createContext() function to create a theme application which he is able to export to the whole app
  - Context.Provider must wrap context
  - You can pass props in here too to pass down to everyone
  - dude I'm not taking notes on a youtube video this is absurd, he proceeds into a tutorial on how to flip themes
  - useContext does things more simply than class based themes
  - honestly this is just an overload, if and when i need to use this to simplify react i will remember there is some function out there called useContext or I will come and scour through my notes. Anyhow.
