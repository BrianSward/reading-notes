# Class 3

## Readings: Testing and Modules

### Reading

- [Read & Write Files in Python](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/)

- this will be real important when we start getting to spreadsheets and the like
- if you open a file make sure you close it, but also don't just open a file use "with open"

- [Exceptions in Python](https://realpython.com/python-exceptions/)

- this is good info here about how to catch errors in python, but it is important to put good information in your excepts so when you get an AssertationError or a TypeError it will throw useful details to the end user or software dev coming along behind you (or even you)

### Videos

- [Read & Write Files in Python - Companion Video](https://realpython.com/courses/reading-and-writing-files-python/)

- They expected us to unlock this access? Is this free? Anyway I think the article about reading and writing and opening files in python covered all the bases here.

### Bookmark and Review

- [Reading and Writing Files in Python Quiz](https://realpython.com/quizzes/read-write-files-python/)

- Well I need more work apparently because the quiz was not all roses and perfection.
