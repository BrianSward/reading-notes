## Readings: Django CRUD and Forms

### Reading

- [Django Forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms)
  - Hah, at first I was like only one reading, yah this is a big one tho...
  - Goes over how to work with forms in Django in particular CRUD is covered
  - "HTML Form" are a field of widgets that populate a page which can be used to gather info from the user
    - These allow us to send POST info
    - "The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside \<form>â€¦</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit"."
    - Forms can have any number of input fields
    - Use method not action per out lecture
    - Django helps us by taking care of the busy work for us when it comes to users interacting with forms in general
  - Django's form handling is a six step process. There are more detailed explanations for each step on the resource.
    1. Display default form when the user requests it the first time.
    2. Submit request, Receive data and bind it to the form.
    3. Clean/validate your data
    4. For invalid data, re-display form, but with user populated values and error messages for problem inputs.
    5. If data all valid:
    - then perform the following actions:
      - save data
      - send an email
      - return the result of a search
      - upload a file, and so on...
    6. When user completes all actions, redirect them to a different page.
  - The Form class is the core of django's "form handling system". Its function is to display and formats widgets
  - You can declare forms and there a bunch of fields in them: BooleanField, CharField, ChoiceField, TypedChoiceField, DateField, DateTimeField, DecimalField, DurationField, EmailField, FileField, FilePathField, FloatField, ImageField, IntegerField, GenericIPAddressField, MultipleChoiceField, TypedMultipleChoiceField, NullBooleanField, RegexField, SlugField, TimeField, URLField, UUIDField, ComboField, MultiValueField, SplitDateTimeField, ModelMultipleChoiceField, ModelChoiceField
    - That's a lot of crap, basically you have a lot of things you can do, here is a list of arguments you can have for these: required, label, label_suffix, initial, widget, help_text, error_messages, validators, localize, disabled
      - See the doc for greater explanations of all these lovely words
  - It lets you perform validation on the fly if you have people prone to inputting poor data
  - It then goes into how to configure your Views, Urls, and Templates respectively, again as my comments yesterday were this being a tutorial it is sorta dry to narrate and take notes on especially since our class lecture mirrored many of these concepts
  - The next place that picks up somewhere "new" would be the part where they get into testing but here they rely on just using the site and seeing if it performs as desired where as in class we had a much more rigid notion of what our tests should be.
  - The summation of all this is that Django simplifies forms. Additionally, Django gives us prebuilt form editing views which can do the following on records inside our database:
    - create
    - edit
    - delete
