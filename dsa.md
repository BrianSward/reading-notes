# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Watch

- [Basic Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEJSJMg4jY)
This video talked about the basic ideas about recursion and how it can deliver neater code all with the warning to avoid infinite loops
- [Data Structures in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVxBVvlnJsM)
This video the guy went over a few very popular data structures where he outlined their advantages and disadvantages
- [Big O Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4cd1O4zkGw)
More info for un about how runtime scales with respect to the input variables. I liked the animations. Seriously they help the dry material.

## Read

- [Basic Data Structures](https://towardsdatascience.com/8-common-data-structures-every-programmer-must-know-171acf6a1a42)
More of the same from above, general descriptions and use cases for different data types
- [Why Big O](https://triplebyte.com/blog/why-you-should-learn-big-o-and-stop-hacking-your-way-through-algorithms)
More opinions and observations on big O and why it matters for us so much.

## Discussion Questions

- What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

We would consider how well the structure does things like get stuff from the structure, or add a new item to the structure. Basically if we want to get something or add to it, it might - will - change which structure we choose based on how the big O if effected.

- How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

To avoid infinite recursive calls make sure you tell them when to stop calling itself. the best way is to clearly define the base and recursive cases to avoid this.
