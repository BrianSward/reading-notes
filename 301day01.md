## Reading

### [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

What is a “component”?

From the reading a component is defined as a:
> "... modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.
> A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.  
> A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties."

What are the characteristics of a component?

- Componetnts are designed to be reused or easily replaced. They should be able to operate in different enviorments and contexts while being able to be extended. Components depict their own appearance and how you'll interact with them all while being mimimally dependent other components.

What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

- Ease of Deployment, Reduced Cost, Ease of Development, Reusable, Modification of Technical Complexity, Reliability, System Maintenance and Evolution, Independent.
