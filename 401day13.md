## Readings: Testing and Modules

### Reading

- [How to Run Linear Regression in Python](https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/how-to-run-linear-regressions-in-python-scikit-learn/)
  - Long story short your friend is Scikit-learn. this lib can also do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to machine learning, analysis of data, and as the reading aludes to, linear regression
  
  - linear regression is useful because it allows us to create best fit lines which model our data
  
  - Useful Key Concepts from Reading (some copied verbatum because there really isn't an easier way to say it)
    - Best Fit ‚Äì the straight line in a plot
    - Coefficient ‚Äì also known as a parameter, is the factor a variable is multiplied by. In linear regression, a coefficient represents changes in a Response Variable (see below).
    - Coefficient of Determination ‚Äì the correlation coefficient denoted as ùëÖ¬≤. Used to describe the precision or degree of fit in a regression.
    - Correlation ‚Äì the relationship between two variables in terms of quantifiable strength and degree, often referred to as the ‚Äòdegree of correlation‚Äô.  Values range between -1.0 and 1.0.
    - Dependent Feature ‚Äì a variable denoted as y in the slope equation y=ax+b. Also known as an Output, or a Response.
    - Estimated Regression Line ‚Äì the straight line that best fits a set of scattered data points.
    - Independent Feature ‚Äì a variable denoted as x in the slope equation y=ax+b. Also known as an Input, or a predictor. 
    - Y-Intercept ‚Äì what happens when x=0 in y=mx+b
    - Least Squares ‚Äì a method of estimating a Best Fit to data
    - Mean ‚Äì an average of a set of numbers is a number, but in linear regression, Mean is modeled by a linear function.
    - Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLS) ‚Äì more commonly known as Linear Regression.
    - Residual ‚Äì distance between avg and data point
    - Regression ‚Äì predictive change estimate of variables in relation to changes in other variables
    - Regression Model ‚Äì the ideal formula for approximating a regression.
    - Response Variables ‚Äì  both the Predicted Response (the value predicted by the regression) and the Actual Response, which is the actual value of the data point (see Figure 1 below).
    - Slope ‚Äì m = (rise/run)
    - Simple Linear Regression ‚Äì a linear regression that has a single independent variable.

    - Check the link for the following detailed guides:
      - Defining Linear Regression Classes
      - Creating Linear Regression Model
      - How to create a Linear Regression and then print the Coefficients (Video Tutorial)
      - How to Create a Linear Regression and Display it
      - How to create a Linear Regression and display it in a Plot (Video Tutorial)

  - Regression vs Classification
    - Basically regression's output variables are continuous, while classification outputs are discrete. "Regression predicts quantity; classification predicts labels."

### Additional Resources

- [Linear Regression in Python](https://realpython.com/linear-regression-in-python/)
  - this reading covers important topics such as the importation of packages and classes which will be helpful to us in our work
  - how to do regression and fit it to your data
  - resuly verification and then how to use the model to predict future outcomes
  - Ultimately this goes over how you can use linear regression in python and a few open source packages which help us in the process. they suggest you use NumPy for your arrays and then either:
    - scikit-learn if you dont need deets
    - statsmodels if you wand advanced stat parameters for models

### Videos

- [Introduction to Simple Linear Regressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsVBBJRb9TE)
  - more of the same but i think the nicest intro to linear regression because i learn much better when using multiple senses at once, being able to see and hear things is very useful to me.
  - i liked the examples because the reason why were doing this was made more clear. as someoen who's done linear modeling before it would be a nicer intro than the readings. like watch this video first, then move into the dry reading as your mind will have better understanding of the concept after listening to this guy blather
  - on a related note, often we're asked if you've done this in real life before and i have created log models to estimate my dogs weight as a full grown dog. i have done pricing models to predict market flux. i have done linear regression on process improvement
