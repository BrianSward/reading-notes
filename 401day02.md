## Readings: Testing and Modules

### Reading

[In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

- TDD is super important. Using this approach you will learn how to write better more reliable, efficient code. There are additional benifits as with this approach you test as you go. we use tests to drive development. we know where we want to get to and test ourselves along the way.

[If name equals main](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/)

- This explains how this will only run code directly and not when it is imported. Also that each file has a __name__ and if its __main__ then this can be run stand alone. if we import this module __name__ is set to the name of the script as python scripts can be imported or ran as stand alone programs.

[Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)

- 2 cases exist here, recursive and base case where the latter is used to terminate the recursive function when base case becomes true
- each recursive call is a wack on the memory so infinite recursion may lead to running out of memory
- This reading gives the following list of recusive algos: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Tower of Hanoi, Fibonacci Series, Factorial Problem, and more...

### Videos

[What on Earth is Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9NEXX1VHc)

- See Above

Optional: [Python Modules and Packages Companion Video](https://realpython.com/courses/python-modules-packages/)

### Bookmark and Review

[Google for Education: Python Lists](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/lists)

- Informative doc on python lists and methods for them.

[Google for Education: Python Strings](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/strings)

- Informative doc on python strings and methods for them.

[Python Modules and Packages](https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/)

- Overview of methods and packages, nomenclature surrounding them and how to import them.

[Pytest Documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

- Documentation for pytest, I can see how this will be useful :D

[PyTest Tutorial](https://www.guru99.com/pytest-tutorial.html) Up to section Running tests in parallel

- This was nice to see it done, but its basically never this easy especially when your pycharm works only as it wants to. So some things are nice to see but useless to me currently because pycharm doesn't work properly. It'll be nice when it plays well with others.

## Things I want to know more about

- I would like a full list of recursive algorithims
