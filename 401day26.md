## Readings: Intro to Django

### Reading

- [Getting started with Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/) Just the Intro to Django section.
  - Object-relational mapper
    - you can define your data models in python
  - URLs and views
    - these blurbs are so short to paraphrase it would be longer than just quoting, what is the f-ing point? "To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views."
  - Templates
    - again, i am suppose to summarize two sentances how exactly? this is stupid busy work, but here is the exact quote because i can't put it any more succinctly, "Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed." 
  - Forms
    - like this is getting stupid, again i quote because there is no reason to rewrite it into the same number of sentances, "Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types. Django also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data."
  - Authentication
    - holy shit this one had three short sentances. to say it has an authentication system, it handles accounts, users, cookies--OH MY GOD I ALREADY TYPED MORE THAN WHAT WAS THERE WHAT IS THE POINT TO SUMMARIZE THIS--it also lets us build sites where users can log on and off
  - Admin
    - automatic admin interface by reading meta data leading to interface 
  - Internationalization
    - you can set it up for localalities, languages, timeszones etc
  - Security
    - Django provides multiple protections against:
      - Clickjacking
      - Cross-site scripting
      - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
      - SQL injection
      - Remote code execution

- [How Django Works Behind the Scenes](https://wsvincent.com/how-django-works-behind-the-scenes/)

  - Django is a web framework for building web applications using the Python programming language. The article explains how Django works behind the scenes by breaking down the request-response cycle.
  - When a user makes a request to a Django web application, the request is received by the web server and passed to the Django application. Django then uses a series of components, such as URL routing and middleware, to process the request and determine which view function should handle the request. The view function then uses the model layer to retrieve data from the database and the template layer to render the data into a response.
  - Django's modular structure allows for easy customization and scaling of web applications. It also includes built-in functionality for handling common web development tasks, such as user authentication and form handling. Overall, Django provides developers with a powerful toolset for quickly building robust and maintainable web applications.
