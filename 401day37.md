## Readings: React 1

YO this was a huge reading, is there a react 2 ;D I hope not.

### Reading

- ES6 Overview
  - [ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview](https://www.taniarascia.com/es6-syntax-and-feature-overview/)
    - The article provides a high-level summary of the new syntax and features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) - I actually had to google this term because it alone confused me - What an odd naming convention for the outsider looking in. The article covers the following topics (and more):
      - Variables: ES6 introduced "let" and "const", with "const" being used for values that shouldn't be changed.
      - Arrow Functions: a shorthand syntax for writing anonymous functions, making them easier to read and write.
      - Template Literals: ES6 introduced a way to embed expressions within string literals, making string interpolation easier. Did python have this first?
      - Destructuring: ES6 allows you to extract values making it easier to access specific data. This is cool, I need to pay attention here.
      - Default Parameters: ES6 allows default values for function parameters in case they are not passed.
      - Spread Operator: ES6 introduces the spread operator, which allows you to spread arrays and objects into separate elements or merge them together. I have used this to spread but I don't think merge yet.
      - Classes: ES6 introduced a new way to create objects using classes, making object-oriented programming in JavaScript easier and more intuitive.
    - The article ends with highlighting benefits of ES6.
      - These include:
        - improved code readability
        - maintainability
        - reduced code complexity

- React
  - [React - Hello World](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
    - This is an intro to React - a popular JavaScript library
    - It explains how to set up a React environment
    - The article also covers the basics of components, which are the building blocks of React applications, and the use of JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript. 
    - Overall, a general starting point for those new - or in need of a refresh - to React to get up and running quickly.
  - [React - JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
    - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows for the inclusion of HTML-like code within JavaScript code. 
    - It was created to make it React easier for devs.
    - **MAIN IDEA**: In JSX, you can write HTML-like elements, attributes, and content within JavaScript, which can then be compiled into JavaScript functions that produce the actual HTML elements to be rendered in the browser. 
    - It was designed to make it all easier to read with the code looking more like the final results.
  - [React - Rendering Elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html)
    - React components can be thought of as pure functions that use props (inputs) and return elements that describe how the component should render (outputs).
    - The article also covers concepts such as updating the component's state, what to do when a component is no longer needed, and the differences between state and props. All of which I pretty much remember from 301 which is nice.
    - Additionally, it mentions the use of React's built-in utility functions like React.createElement & React.Fragment
      - These allow for creating and returning multiple elements without the need for a container element. 
    - The article serves as an introduction to the basics of rendering elements in React, and like the others is great for people new to React
  - [React - Components & Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
    - Components are the lego of a React application
    - They allow devs to split their user interface into reusable and composable pieces
    - **MAIN POINT**: The article explains how to create components and pass props to them, and also covers topics such as default props and typechecking props to ensure that components are being used correctly. It also explains how to access and use props within the component's render method to generate the component's output.
    - TL:DR This is your resource for props and components
  - [React - State & Lifecycle](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
    - This article covers two key concepts, State and Lifestyle
      - **State**: A state is a plain JavaScript object that represents the components internal data. In React, the state can change over time, and the component re-renders whenever the state changes. We saw this happen in class with the App Adam was making.
      - **Lifestyle Methods**: React provides a set of methods that are called at different stages in the process of rendering a component, such as when it is created, updated, or destroyed. By using these lifecycle methods, devs can run some code at specific moments in a component's lifecycle, for example to fetch data from an API when the component is created or to perform some cleanup when the component is destroyed.
  - [React - Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
  - The link is a tutorial on how to handle events in React
  - It covers the following topics:
    - Understanding events in React, SyntheticEvent, Event handlers in React, event handler binding, common handling scenarios.
  - The tutorial provides code examples to demonstrate each of the concepts covered. But like I'm not going to bore you with that, you should just check it out when you're stumped on OnClick nonsense

- Tailwind CSS
  - [Utility First CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)
    - Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed CSS classes to quickly style HTML elements. 
    - It is designed to help developers to write fast-loading, responsive and highly customizable user interfaces. It follows the "utility-first" approach, meaning that instead of providing a set of predefined UI components, it provides a set of low-level utility classes that can be combined to create custom designs.

    - **THIS VIDEO IS PRIVATE**

- Next.js
  - [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
    - Next.js is a JavaScript framework for building server-rendered or statically-generated web applications. The link above contains a tutorial on Next.js.
      - Contained here are the basic steps for getting started with Next.js. The tutorial goes into more detail on each step and provides additional information on how to customize your Next.js app. I just, there has been so much and I still have two videos. 
  - [Why to use Next.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtgbaKBhdkk)
    - React fan-boy talks about the future of React, which he says is Next.js
    - I don't think his lips match the sound, it really bugs me
    - He gives a background on React and Next.js
    - Next.js allows us to decide on where it is rendered, client side or server side.
    - getStaticPass and getStaticProps he seems to be into
    - A long winded talk on performance of Next.js which seems to allow for scaling and such as you're only loading a page at a time (if you elect to which like you sould)
    - Next.js takes into account the dev experience which he seems to imply it makes out life better (he keeps talking about plug in set ups)
    - He is also high on how you deploy Next.js - huge plug for vercel but ANY node server will work, you can selfhost or aws it as well.
    - Huge dev community, they work with google and facebook.
      - 5 of top 12 companies use it
    - Future might be the merger of front and back end
