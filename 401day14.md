## Readings: Data Visualizations

### Reading

- [Matplotlib Tutorial](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/matplotlib/)
  - they say that matplotlib is the single most used 2d graphics program for python.
  - there is so much you can do in matplotlib:
    - you can plot, change colors and widths. set limits, set ticks, label things, move axis, add legands, annotate your important points, sub plots to arrange your plots, axes for even more customization, ANIMATION, earthquake
  - there are many many visualiztion formats
  - I can see how these would have helped me when doing pricing modeling, im not sure if this would have been easier than the native excel as my sets were not in the 10,000s of rows. but now knowing this I feel much more confident approaching large spreadsheets

### Bookmark and Review

- [Seaborn Tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)
  - Seaboard is a lib to help with graphics in python. it is particularly good at doing statistics stuff for us, works nice with matplotlib and like we were shown in class this can help us even open our datasets and color things in nice pretty pictures
- [Bokeh Tutorial](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/master?filepath=tutorial%2F00%20-%20Introduction%20and%20Setup.ipynb)
  - a modern interactive visualization library that uses modern browsers for presentations
