# Class One Notes

## Markdown Guide

- Overview
Markdown is used to quickly mockup and format webpages
Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in our readings.

Markdown can format the following areas

- Headings
  - Heading Best Practices - Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.
- Paragraphs
  - Paragraph Best Practices - Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.
- Line Breaks
  - Line Break Best Practices - You can use two or more spaces (commonly referred to as “trailing whitespace”) for line breaks in nearly every Markdown application, but it’s controversial
- Emphasis (things like bold, italic, )
- Blockquotes (You can nest bloackquotes)
  - Blockquotes Best Practices - For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.
- Lists (Ordered Lists and Unordered Lists)
  - Ordered List Best Practices -  For compatibility, use periods only.
- Unordered List Best Practices - Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. For compatibility, don’t mix and match delimiters in the same list — pick one and stick with it.
- You can add blocks of code
- You can make lines with Horizontal Rules using 3 * or -
- You can add images, links, and even HTML but we shouldn't do that now
- You can Mention people
- HTML is more configurable than Markdown but that is to be expected
