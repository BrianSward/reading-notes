# Class One Notes

For me a **Growth Mindset**, is the meta approach to learning by active participation in the process coupled with the understanding that improvement is a process fraught with trail and failure.

Reminders to stay in growth mindset:

- You have to walk before you run
- All things pass
- Talking a break and coming back with a fresh mindset
