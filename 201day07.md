# Day 7 Reading Notes

## Reading

### [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)

_Explain why we need domain modeling._

- to help model problems to easier find solutions, or to gain a complete understanding of the problem at hand

### [HTML Table Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics)

_Why should tables not be used for page layouts?_

- they reduce accessibility for visually impared users, their use can make it harder to code by creating something called 'code soup'

_List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>._

- \<th> denotes a header and not a cell
- \<td> denotes table data
- \<tr> creates tables rows?

I really am taking stabs in the dark here

### [Introducing Constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#introducing_constructors)

_What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?_

- its an easier way to create and return new objects while using this in your constructor code

_How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?_

- you capitalize the first letter of it

### [Object Prototypes Using A Constructor](https://ui.dev/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype)

_Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience._
(NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question)

- prototype are object properties that all functions in javascript have. they allow us to share methods across all instances of a function. the reading doesn't even explain inheritance, it references another post where these are explained. this whole post was confusing and made me want to walk away from my computer.

### Bookmark and Review

- [HTML Table Advanced Features and Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Advanced)

## Things I want to know more about

- semantic table html, what that means and where i can find exaples
- the object prototype stuff made little to no sense
