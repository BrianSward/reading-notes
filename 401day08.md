## Readings: Ten Thousand 3

### Reading

- [List Comprehension](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python)
  - highly useful because how often we use lists in python
  - range can create a list of digits for you
  - they cover the example we had in our warmup - maybe I should do the reading before class :D, although i do think i have better comprehension when doing it after
  - they show an example of how you can use it to return a certain character in a string by using a list of authors and returning the first letter of each authors name
  - you can use list comprehension to uppercase and lowercase lists you currently have
  - using isdigit() seems helpful to string apart numbers from letters in the example they show, we seperate phone numbers from names
  - list comprehension is so useful you can even use it with files, in the example in the reading a poem is input and each line of the poem is output individually.
  - to further belabor the point you can use functions as arguements to list comprehension, here they showed us another approach to doing math across a list generated by range(a,b)
  - the final section is about doing conditions and tacking them on to the end, so they added the inspection of mod 2 and only doing the function across that list. too cool.

### Audio

- OPTIONAL [Debugging with PySnooper](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/pysnooper-python-debugging-episode-241/)
  - as this is an optional listen i will save it to my phone and listen to it when i have time. I do know about pysnooper and how it will break your code down line by line showing what it creates and what happens at each spot. i can easily see the utility in this and have found online tools which do this for you but render it out graphically which i find easier to use
    - [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit)
      - I feel like this link does basically the same as pysnooper but i get to see it with my peepers as its peeping
