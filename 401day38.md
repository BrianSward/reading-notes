## Readings: React 2

### Reading

- [React - Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
  - "Conditional Rendering" in React is a way of deciding what elements to render in a React component based on certain conditions. 
  - The article provides different ways of implementing conditional rendering, such as:
    - using if/else statements
    - ternary operators
    - short-circuiting with the logical operator &&
  - The article also explains the concept of "inline if with logical && operator" and the "inline if-else with conditional operator". 
  - Finally, there are tips for choosing the right approach based on the complexity and readability of the code.
- [React - Lists & Keys](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)
  - "Lists and Keys" in React, is about rendering lists of elements in a React component. 
  - The article discusses how to use the map() function to render a list of elements, and the importance of assigning a "key" prop to each list item. 
  - It then explains why keys are necessary for optimizing updates and rendering in React, and how to choose the right keys for your list items. 
  - Additionally, it discusses common mistakes to avoid when working with lists in React, like:
    - using the index of an item as its key
    - or, not updating the key when the list changes
  - The article ends with best practices for working with lists and keys in React to name a few:
    - using unique and stable keys
    - rendering items based on their data, not their position in the list.
- [React - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)
  - The one is about "Forms" in React, how to implement and handle forms in React components. 
  - The article starts by introducing controlled and uncontrolled components and the differences between them.
  - Next, it explains how to handle form input changes, validate form inputs, and submit forms. 
  - The article also covers advanced topics such as:
    - working with select boxes
    - checkboxes
    - radio buttons
    - as well as integrating with third-party form libraries. 
  - Additionally, there are tips for improving the performance and accessibility of your forms, such as using the onBlur event instead of onChange for input validation, and using the HTML "label" element to associate form controls with their labels. 
- [React - Lifting State](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)
  - The article is about the concept of sharing state between components that are not parent-child components. 
  - The article explains why "lifting state up" is useful, and provides an example of how to lift state up from multiple components to a common ancestor. 
  - It also covers best practices for lifting state up, such as keeping the state with the most specific component that requires it, and lifting the state only as high as necessary. 
  - There are a couple examples of when it might be necessary to lift state up, such as when components need to share data or coordinate with each other, or when a common parent component needs to enforce a certain behavior on its child components. 
- [React - Composition vs Inheritance](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html)
  - In React, Composition vs Inheritance, compares two ways of sharing code between components in React. 
  - It explains the concept of composition and how it can be used to reuse code by combining smaller components into larger components. 
  - It also explains the concept of inheritance, and how it can be used to reuse code by creating a hierarchy of components that inherit from a common base component. 
  - The article then compares and contrasts these two approaches, and provides guidelines for choosing between composition and inheritance based on the specific needs of your application. 
  - The benefits of composition were glossed, such as being more flexible and easier to reason about, and the benefits of inheritance, such as providing a clear hierarchy and structure for your components.
- [Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
  - The article "Thinking in React" is a guide for developing applications with React by breaking down the process into small steps. 
  - It begins with the concept of breaking down a user interface into components, 
  - It then goes over the process of building a simple React application from scratch. - The following steps were used:
    - Start with a mock: Begin by sketching a static version of the user interface.
    - Break the UI into a component hierarchy: Divide the static UI into components, and decide what state and props each component should have.
    - Build a static version in React: Build a static version of the application using React, without any interactivity.
    - Identify the minimal state: Determine what state is required for the application to function, and where it should live.
    - Add interactivity with state: Add interactivity to the application by using the state and props.
