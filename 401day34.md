## Readings: API Deployment

### Reading

- [Django Settings Best Practices](https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/)

- The article "Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices" provides guidelines on how to manage and configure settings in a Django app.
- **Key takeaways from the article:**
  - Store Django settings in a separate module:
    - It is recommended to keep the settings in a separate module, far away from the main Django module, to improve maintainability and modularity and avoid any drama.
    - I don't think we did this in our class I wonder why?
  - Use environment variables for sensitive information:
    - Sensitive information such as passwords and secret keys. 
    - These should be stored as environment variables to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands or being exposed to the public.
  - Use settings files for different environments:
    - Different settings files should be used for development, production, and testing environments.
    - This will allow for easy configuration of the different environments and prevent any confusion.
  - Use the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable:
    - The DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable should be used to switch between different settings files similar to swapping channels TV.
  - Create custom settings modules for reusability:
    - Using custom settings modules for reusable settings will save time and effort in the long run.

## Things I want to know more about

- The reading seems to say we should store our settings in a seperate module, why didn't we do this in class?
