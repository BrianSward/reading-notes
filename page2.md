## Choosing A Text Editor by The Older Coder
- Seems to say try them all and choose what you like most
- Editor vs IDE
### Important Parts of Editor
- code completion
- syntax highlighting
- hemes (as they help to reduce eye strain/fatigue)
- selection of extensions available when you need them
### Suggested Apps
- Notepad++
- TextWrangler/BB Edit (Mac only trash)
- Visual Studio Code

- Brackets
- Sublime Text
- Putty
Don’t pay for an app, seems like there are lots of good free ones that exist

## Linux Tutorial
Command Line of Linux is a strange place even for people highly familiar with MSDOS
The Linux Terminal is how you interact with this command line interface of Linux
Shells determine how system behaves and appears
Commands are stored and accessed via up and down arrows
When using commands we call upon Active and Relative Paths
ls Documents vs ls /home/ryan/Documents
Other Useful Path Info
- ~ is your home
- . is your current
- .. is your parent (... is parent of parent, etc…)
- pwd - shows you where you are
- ls - directory contents
- cd - change directories
All things (including directories) are files in Linux
There are no extensions
Linux is CasE SenSITive
Avoid spaces in names for ease
ls -a will list all files, including hidden ones
