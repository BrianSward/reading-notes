## Reading

### [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

What is functional programming?

- "Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia"

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- the reading defined it as follows It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic) and it does not cause any observable side effects

What are the benefits of a pure function?

- the code is easier to test

What is immutability?

- that something won't change with time and that it is unable to be changed

What is Referential transparency?

- this is when we have the god tier power of pure functions added to immutable data

## Videos

[Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)

What is a module?

- logical divisions which have seperate functionalities

What does the word ‘require’ do?

- when we want to use functionality of functions in other modules we bring them in with require

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

- we have tp explicitly state by using module.export

What do we have to do to make a module available?

- set the require equal to a variable, "var counter = require('./count')" is the example in the video
