### Reading

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.

Review at least one article from both “Ethics in the workplace” and “Ethics in Technology” sections below and write how each of them relates to ethics in technology. Do you agree or disagree with these articles? What stuck out to you specifically from each article?

For each article that you choose, write a minimum 5 sentences (1 paragraph). Each reflection should be something of substance and of an acceptable quality.

- [Google and AI](https://gizmodo.com/in-reversal-google-says-its-ai-will-not-be-used-for-we-1826649327)
  - This article is about an announcement Google made where it outlined that it will not allow its AI technology to be used in developing weapons or for surveillance purposes that violate international laws and norms. This decision comes after months of internal protests and an employee petition. The announcement is a major policy change and could potentially mark a turning point in the global industrial military complex. For those like me who do not support this complex, this announcement is a welcome development, as it could mean that the world's most powerful tech companies will start taking responsibility for the ways in which their technologies are used, and will start prioritizing ethical considerations over profit. Now only if Palantir would f-off.

- [Big Data is our Civil Rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)
  - For someone with a keen interest in data/math/and all things dorky this article was actually pretty thought-provoking and it emphasized the critical need for data ethics and literacy. The author argues that as data-driven decisions increasingly shape our lives, the absence of safeguards to protect against bias and discrimination in data can have far-reaching and harmful consequences. The article points out the potential of data to reinforce systemic inequalities and amplify the power of those who already hold privilege. The article serves as a call to action for data professionals to be more conscious of the impact of their work and to push for greater accountability and regulation in the use of data. Personally I think as data and tech turn us into dollar signs there should be a level of transparency about the information everyone has. Basically I think we should own our own data about ourselves or be able to request the entire collection.
