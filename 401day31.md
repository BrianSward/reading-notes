## Readings: Django REST Framework & Docker

### Reading

- [Beginner’s Guide to Docker](https://wsvincent.com/beginners-guide-to-docker/)
- Docker is a way for you to isolate and run apps.
- Docker doesn't care about your os
- Entire programming enviorment is isolated including but not limited top the data, the packages, and the language.
- Virtual Enviorments only isolate python software, Dockers do much more and aren't limited in this way.
- What proceeds after that is a long tutorial on how to set up Docker, I will refer to this link if I have any questions.
- And to quote the conclusion
- The important takeaways from this tutorial are this:
  - Docker is a way to run Linux containers
  - Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
  - Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image
  - Images are made up of one or more layers
  - Containers are a running instance of an image docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container
  - Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases.

- [Django for APIs - Library Website](https://djangoforapis.com/library-website-and-api/) May ask you for email because it’s a sample chapter for (fantastic) book they’re selling.
- It did not thankfully
- This too covers setting up a django project, the steps required to make it all work and have it ready to add Django REST framework to ultimately change a django website into a web API
- The article begins with a description that django rest framework works alongside django web frameworks and together they create apis
- It immediately jumped into how to make a django project and I will omit the notes of this as I can always just visit this site for future reference. Ultimately this is more reference to get my projects up and running. And I see its direct relation to our lab today.
