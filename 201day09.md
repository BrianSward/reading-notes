_How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?_

- events are actions that occur on the thing you're programming. so in real life if i was programming a subway route the events would be the stops along the way on the ride. these events provide information, such as the location of the stop, and then based upon location the rider of the subway can choose to disembark

_When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?_

- the name of the event we are looking for and the actions to take when that event is triggered/in response to it.

_Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?_

- because that is the information the end user is supplying

_What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?_

- In bubbling, the innermorst element handles the event by first capturing and handling it  and then sends it to the outer elements. With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements
