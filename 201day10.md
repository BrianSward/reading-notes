### [What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong).

Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- a syntax error is when you type something in wrong or try to call a function or object and fail to use correct notation. a logic error is when you anger mr. spock, in these cases your syntax is correct but you have an error in thought which is leading to inncorrect results. the reading says the latter is more difficult to solve.

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- oh god, recently i had all my code correct but at the end of a method i had added an character on accident. this led to that value not being seen as a number. all of the code was 100% correct but there was this one spot where my syntax was jacked up due to sloppy typing/a miss stroke of keys.

How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- oh being able to tell the difference between where you have screwed up is very helpful. you should be able to console.log you stuff to see what you're getting for result. if the code executes and you see hot garbage you know your syntax is prob messed up, if you see information being rendered correctly but it itself is incorrect then you have to check out what got you to this point step by step.

  ultimately i think this topic will hold major sway over our future as programmers because being able to suss out your own mistakes will save you a lot of time bother senior devs who dont have time to search for your missing semi colons.

[The JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger).

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

- it helps you monitor the values in the sysyem and to set places in your code where you want to pause for a moment and id/look at problems which prevent your code from being epic

Define what a breakpoint is.

- these are halts to your code to see what is happening and allow you to more easily debug your JS

What is the call stack?

- The call stack part of the debugging window shows you what code was executed to get you were you are at the current breakpoint. 

### Bookmark and Review

[Debugging HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Debugging_HTML)

- this article provided useful tips and tricks on how you start to debug your html, css, JS, and other languages you will learn. it explains how to use things like error messages and even mark up validation services to see what is happening in your code

[Debugging CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Debugging_CSS)

- this article similar to the one above delves into the developer tool window and how to use this resource to make your css behave closer to what you were expected if not exactly. it goes over a lot of the material we have already seen from DON to the box model and how those concepts play a role in rendering/debugging.

## Things I want to learn more about

- games for debugging code? anything like this out there?
