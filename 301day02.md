# Day 2

## Reading

### [React lifecycle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

- Render will happen first.

What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

- constructors are the first  react componenets are called prior to mounting 

Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

- constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount

What does componentDidMount do?

- this is where you would include things which load using network requests and act as a good place for subscriptions.

## Videos

### [React State Vs Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)

THIS VIDEO DID NOT LOAD 


What types of things can you pass in the props?

- props are the arguement to functions, we can pass things like initial states of systems, things that generally dont change inside programs, like a title or something.

What is the big difference between props and state?

- props will be passed into a component while state is handled inside the component vs props which are handled outside the component and must be updated outside the component

When do we re-render our application?

- when we want to update information, either when given new props, or when states change and the user would need to know

What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

- a counter where we want to store something. when we want to re-render and update the screen based upon the user's actions. states are also very useful in forms, but again a form is something the user interacts with so that shoul de clear
