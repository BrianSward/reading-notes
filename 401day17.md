### Reading

- [Web Scrape with Python in 4 minutes](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-web-scrape-with-python-in-4-minutes-bc49186a8460)
  - Web scraping is a method of extracting information from a website. Python offers several libraries to perform web scraping such as Beautiful Soup and Selenium
    - Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages
    - Selenium is a library that can be used to control a web browser for web scraping
  - To use Beautiful Soup
    - you first need to install it, and then import it into your Python script
    - You also need to import a library to handle requests, such as the requests library
    - Next, you can use the requests.get() function to download the HTML content of a website
    - The content attribute of the response object contains the HTML content
    - You can pass this HTML content to Beautiful Soup's .prettify() function to format the HTML and make it easier to work with
  - You can then use Beautiful Soup's various methods to navigate and search the HTML tree and extract the desired information
  - Selenium, you also needs to install it, and then import it into your Python script
  - You also need to import a web driver, such as Chrome, Firefox or others to interact with browser
  - Then you can use the browser-specific driver to interact with webpages, scraping information, and even automate tasks such as filling out forms and clicking buttons.
- [What is Web Scraping?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)
  - Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated software
  - It can be used for a variety of purposes, such as market research, price comparison, and data analysis
  - Common techniques used in web scraping include using APIs, parsing HTML and XML, and using browser automation tools
  - There are many libraries and frameworks available to assist with web scraping, such as Beautiful Soup, Scrapy, and Selenium
  - Legal and ethical issues surrounding web scraping include issues with copyright and trademark infringement, data privacy, and potential harm to the performance of the targeted website
  - It is important to check a website's terms of service before scraping its data and to be mindful of any potential negative consequences that may arise from scraping.
- [How to scrape websites without getting blocked](https://www.scrapehero.com/how-to-prevent-getting-blacklisted-while-scraping/)
  - I like that the last one was about legal and ethical issues and this is this one :D
  - Follow website's terms of use and robots.txt file
  - Use a unique user agent and IP address
  - Limit the number of requests sent to a website
  - Respect website's rate limits and time delays
  - Keep a record of all requests and responses
  - Use a VPN or proxy to hide your IP address
  - Test your scraping code and monitor for errors
  - Use scraping tools that have built-in anti-blacklisting features
  - Be respectful and courteous when contacting website owners for permission to scrape.

### Videos

- [Track Amazon Prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY)
  - Pretty great example of webscraping in practice. Reinforces what we were shown in class and the lab we had for homework tonight, I really need to do the reading before I do the assignments.
