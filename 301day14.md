### [Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

- Personal computers started showing up in people’s homes and holywood kept using the narrative that geeky boys use computers to get girls. Which like, as a child of the 70s who grew up mostly preinternet this is a laughable notion. Computers were like kryptonite to most women in 1992. Trust.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

- Because it reinforced the false notion that computers were toys for boys and it gave them exposure which allowed them to have prior experience that others (women) didn’t have due to the effects of the stereotypes that computers are for boys

When are diversity efforts most successful?

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

- A more diverse company can serve a more diverse user base because there will be people in the company representing those user bases. So there will be someone to speak up for left handed people, or someone to speak up for the opinions of women or minorities, they will then make products which appeal more to people of these often overlooked groups
