# My Reading Notes
##### A Dangerous Realm of Nonsense and Neuro Divergenrt Tendencies

## Day 1 - 6/27/2022

This is where I'm going to put *my* reading assignments.

For me a **Growth Mindset**, is the meta approach to learning by active participation in the process coupled with the understanding that improvement is a process frought with trail and failure. 

Reminders to stay in growth mindset:
- You have to walk before you run
- All things pass
- Step 3: Profit, or perhaps talking a break and getting a cup of coffee
