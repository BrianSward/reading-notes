# My Reading Notes!

This is where I'm going to put *my* reading assignments.

to me **Growth Mindset** is the meta approach to learning by active participation in the process and understanding that improvement is a process frought with trail and failure. 

Reminders to stay in growth mindset:
- You have to walk before you run
- All things pass
- Profit
