# Course 102
## Day 1 - 6/27/2022

This is where I'm going to put *my* reading assignments.

For me a **Growth Mindset**, is the meta approach to learning by active participation in the process coupled with the understanding that improvement is a process fraught with trail and failure. 

Reminders to stay in growth mindset:
- You have to walk before you run
- All things pass
- Talking a break and coming back with a fresh mindset
