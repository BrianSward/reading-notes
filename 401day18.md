## Readings: Cryptography

### Reading

- [Encryption, Decryption & Hacking](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:online-data-security/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:data-encryption-techniques/a/encryption-decryption-and-code-cracking)
  - Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a coded form called ciphertext, making it unreadable by unauthorized parties.
  - Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, converting ciphertext back into plain text.
  - Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
  - Asymmetric encryption uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
  - Code cracking is the process of trying to find the key used in encryption in order to decrypt the ciphertext.
  - Code cracking can be done through techniques such as brute force, where all possible keys are tried, or through weaknesses in the encryption algorithm.
  - Cryptography has its roots in the military and was used to secure communication.
  - In modern times, cryptography is used for secure data transmission, secure online communication, and secure storage of sensitive data.
  - The use of cryptographic techniques can ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data.
  - Cryptography can be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of both.

- [Ceasar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
  - The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used it to encrypt his private messages. I heard before this wasn't true so like I don't believe it.
  - In a Caesar cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabet to form the ciphertext. For example, using a key of 3, A would become D, B would become E, and so on.
  - The Caesar cipher is considered a very basic form of encryption and can easily be broken by simple frequency analysis or by trying different keys.
  - In practice, keys are commonly used in the range of 1 to 25, but in theory, any integer value can be used as the key resulting in a possible shift of any size.
  - The method is now considered to be insecure for any commercial use, but is still popular for teaching encryption and for some simple cryptographic puzzles.

### Videos

- [Cryptography Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o)
  - This is a video about the history and historical uses of cryptography.
  - Cryptography and war go hand in hand.
  - They go into the modern ways we secure our networks and online shopping safe and the methods they use

## Things I want to know more about

- I do care quite a bit about learning how to do quantum computing with python. i've seen the libraries but haven't made it to them yet
