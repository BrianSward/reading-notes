### [Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)

What is a ‘call’?

- these are function invocations inside of the javascript engine

How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

- only one call can be done at a time, the rest are tossed into the stack to get done with

What does LIFO mean?

- last in first out, or your friend and mine stack

Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

this is directly from our reading

First we run out code, this is the order of operations we have:

1. When secondFunction() gets executed, an empty stack frame is created. It is the main (anonymous) entry point of the program.
2. secondFunction() then calls firstFunction()which is pushed into the stack.
3. firstFunction() returns and prints “Hello from firstFunction” to the console.
4. firstFunction() is pop off the stack.
5. The execution order then move to secondFunction().
6. secondFunction() returns and print “The end from secondFunction” to the console.
7. secondFunction() is pop off the stack, clearing the memory.

What causes a Stack Overflow?

- when a function is recursive and has no way to escape the code block it is in, they specfically call it code without and exit point

### [JavaScript error messages](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c)

What is a ‘reference error’?

- a common when using things like const and let, is trying to use a variable before you have declared it

What is a ‘syntax error’?

- this can happen when you have typed out a mess and forgot required elements of things, like semi colons or brackets. it cal also happen if you try to parse something non-parseable

What is a ‘range error’?

- when you are messing around with objects which have length and you exceed that length

What is a ‘tyep error’?

- it is very ironic that there is a typing error in type error as it is spelled here. type errors are when you try to access a property on something which is undefined

What is a breakpoint?

- these are used in debugging and the program will stop the program when they encounter specific conditions defined in the breakpoint

What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

- by using the green play button or f5 you can enter a debugging mode which can have you advance line by line or when breakpoints are met
